# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Description

This project covers various search algorithms in C, including linear search and binary search. It aims to provide an understanding of these algorithms, their implementation, and their complexities.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- The best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Requirements

- **Editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Compilation**: All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **Style**: Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- **Restrictions**: 
  - No global variables
  - No more than 5 functions per file
  - Only allowed to use the `printf` function of the standard library
- **Prototypes**: The prototypes of all functions should be included in your header file called `search_algos.h`
- **Header files**: All your header files should be include guarded

## Files

### Mandatory Tasks

#### 0. Linear search

- **File**: `0-linear.c`
- **Prototype**: `int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);`
- **Description**: Searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm.
- **Requirements**:
  - Return the first index where the value is located
  - If the value is not present or if the array is NULL, return -1
  - Print each value checked during the search process

#### 1. Binary search

- **File**: `1-binary.c`
- **Prototype**: `int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);`
- **Description**: Searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm.
- **Requirements**:
  - Assume that array will be sorted in ascending order
  - Assume that value wonâ€™t appear more than once in array
  - Return the index where the value is located
  - If the value is not present or if the array is NULL, return -1
  - Print the array being searched every time it changes
